# Phase 1 Deliverables:

In your team’s GitHub repo, create a folder named “Phase_1” with three PDF files:

- team#_p1_ifd.pdf - your IFD
- team#_p1_eer.pdf - your EER
- team#_p1_report.pdf - your data types, constraints, task decomposition, and abstract code
(Replace the # with your full team number, so if you are Team001, files would be "team001_p1_ifd.pdf"…)

You may optionally combine your EER, IFD, and report into a single file named team#_p1_report.pdf, if you like keeping everything together in one file.

There may be a grade deduction for any files not named correctly or if we cannot clearly determine which work should be graded in your repository because you did not put them in a “Phase_1” folder.
