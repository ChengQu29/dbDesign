What To Submit:

All files should be in a folder named "Phase_2". You are welcome to put these all in one file or in four separate files.  All non-SQL files submitted should be in pdf format.  If you choose to use one file, please name it “team##_p2_report.pdf”.  If you submit individual files, please use these names:

- team#_p2_ac+SQL.pdf
- team#_p2_eer2rel.pdf
- team#_p2_schema.sql (note that this is only non-pdf file)
- team#_p2_updatedEER.pdf

(Replace # with the full number of your team, so if you are Team001, files would be "team001_p2_ac+SQL.pdf"…)

Please review the sample submission that is posted in Files on Canvas.  Your deliverables should be similar to those in the sample submission.  There may be a grade deduction for any files not named correctly or if we cannot clearly determine which work should be graded in your repository.
